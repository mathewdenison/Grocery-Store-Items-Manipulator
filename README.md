# Grocery-Store-Items-Manipulator
This is a program that allows you to calculate total items in a given txt file, create a histogram for visual representation of totals, and search and item by name to get individual item's total
I felt that my code was well modularized and clean, without a lot of extra unneccessary "fluf". I also felt that the histogram output looks really nice.
Some enhancements that could be made is to modularize/simplify my menu function which would make it more readable, understandable to the next user. It would also make the code more efficient when outputting in the future.
The one thing I felt was most difficult is how to implement python code in a CPP project. The function calls to Python code seem complex and difficult to reference. I did utilize the online tutoring, but Stack Overflow seems to be very helpful as well!
The main skill I believe that is useful is the ability to call another programming language that is better suited for specific tasks in a CPP project. This allows you to create greate menus/visual outputs, while having calculations done with a faster to compile language.
The best example of how this program is maintainable, readable and adaptable is my use of functions and function calls instead of writing most of the code directly to main. I also implemented plenty of comments for the next user/me to understand. This will be great in the future when I might come back to this project later on in my coding career.
